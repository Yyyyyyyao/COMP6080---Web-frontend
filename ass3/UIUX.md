UI/UX Guide

1. When user as a host wants to publish a listing,
    He can add multiple dates at one Calendar by click "Add Date" 
    and he can also select the target field to change the date he chose before publish. 

2. At main page search engine, user can filter listings by selecting dates, limiting price, bed countss and rating range all together by clicking "Search at the end".

3. At filtering, if user doesn't want the upper or lower bound, he can just leave it empty and the search functionality still works. 

4. The whole design idea is try to give infomation that user needs. For example, at the main page, the product details only show that related to filters such as number of bedrooms. 

5. For better user experience, we use a calender for user to select dates. But also user can input the dates using the calender.

6. We apply a lot icons to simplify the design, because icons are informative and simple. 

7. We use simple black and white as our main theme color for great contrast and luxury feeling.

8. In order to show some information without page jumping, for example, the advance feature of different rating reviews, we use a modal to show the reviews, user can close it and make a booking without page jumping.

9. in the listing detail page, the price is changing while user selecting the booking dates. It give immediately feedback to user to let them know the price for their booking.

10. The booking confirmation badge have different color for different status.
    10.1 pending : grey. 
    10.2 success : green
    10.3 declined: red
    These three color fits the three condition very well. It can give proper feedback to user.
